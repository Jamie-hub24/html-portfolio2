<h1>My Hobbies</h1>

<h2>Coding</h2>

<p>
    I find coding to be both a logical puzzle and a creative outlet. 
    Whether it's building web applications, designing game mechanics, or 
    experimenting with new programming languages, I love the process of turning 
    an idea into something tangible. Right now, I'm focusing on C# and Unity game
    development and full-stack web development, blending technical skills with
    creative problem-solving.
</p>

<h2>Reading & Creative Writing</h2>

<p>
    Reading has always been a gateway to new worlds for me. I love how literature
    can shift your perspective, change your mood, and transport you somewhere 
    entirely new. Whether it's classic novels, modern fiction, or books on the 
    craft of writing, I find immense joy in exploring different styles and ideas.
</p>
  

<p>
    Alongside reading, I'm deeply passionate about creative writing. I enjoy 
    experimenting with different storytelling techniques, always looking for new 
    ways to bring characters and worlds to life. I've written short stories, and
    I'm currently working on a children's novel, weaving together themes that 
    resonate with young readers while building toward a grander narrative. 
    Writing, for me, is both an art and an explorationâ€”an ongoing journey of 
    discovery.
</p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>

<p>
    I love games that tell deep, engaging stories. Narrative-driven RPGs are my 
    favourites, and I'm fascinated by how games can create immersive worlds and 
    emotional experiences. This passion for storytelling in games has naturally 
    led me to explore narrative design and game development.
</p>

<p>
    My favourite games include the Life Is Strange series, The Last of Us
    Parts 1 & 2, Mass Effect, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2,
    the Dragon Age series, The Witcher 3, Night In The Woods (which I think is 
    possibly the best written game ever), and the Telltale Walking Dead series.
</p>


<h2>Music</h2>

<p>
    Music has always been a huge part of my life. I play the guitar, and I'm 
    drawn to genres that have depth and atmosphere, like post-rock and classic 
    rock. Whether it's listening to expansive, cinematic soundscapes or playing 
    my own riffs, music is something that inspires me and helps me think 
    creatively.
</p>


<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>
    I enjoy philosophy because it challenges me to think critically about the 
    world and my place in it. Whether it's discussing ethics, free will, or 
    existentialism, I find that philosophy provides a great way to engage with 
    big ideas and question assumptions.
</p>

<h2>Art</h2>

<p>
    I've always been drawn to art that captures movement, emotion, and light. 
    The Impressionists are a favourite of mine, as their work feels alive and 
    expressive. I also appreciate modern art, especially pieces that challenge 
    conventional ideas and explore new ways of seeing the world.
</p>

<h2>Film and Film Making</h2>

<p> 
    Film is a medium that combines storytelling, visual composition, sound 
    design, and more into a powerful experience. I enjoy films that transport 
    me to different worlds and offer new perspectives. Over the years, I've 
    explored filmmaking as a way to tell stories and experiment with visual 
    techniques. I've taken several filmmaking and photography courses, 
    including an intensive weekend course at Ealing Studios, gaining 
    hands-on experience in bringing ideas to life.
</p>

<h2>Gardening</h2>

<p>
   There's something incredibly grounding about working with plants. It is an
   ongoing process of learning about nature and enjoying it's natural rhythms
   and cycles. My garden is an evolving experiment, and I enjoy figuring out 
   which plants will thrive in my alkaline soil - which can be a major 
   challenge! Recently, I've been working on a rockery project, finding ways 
   to create a visually appealing and sustainable garden without breaking the 
   bank.
